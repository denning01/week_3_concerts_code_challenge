# Concerts Code Challenge
This Python script interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage concert data for bands and venues. It allows you to retrieve information such as whether a concert is in the band's hometown, create new concerts, and get details about concerts and bands, using SQL queries. The script uses the psycopg2 library to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

# Features
Hometown Show Check: Checks if the concert is happening in the band's hometown.
Band Introduction: Generates an introduction string for a concert.
Add a Concert: Adds a new concert for a band at a specific venue and date.
List Band Introductions: Retrieves all introductions for a particular band.
Most Concert Performances: Finds the band with the most performances.
Concert at Venue on a Date: Finds the first concert on a specified date at a given venue.
